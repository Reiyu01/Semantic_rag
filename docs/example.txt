RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is an approach that combines an external
retrieval step (searching a knowledge base or documents) to provide context and a generative
model that conditions on that retrieved context to produce answers.

This demo shows how to index local text files into a vector store and use a small generator
(model) to answer user queries using the retrieved passages.
